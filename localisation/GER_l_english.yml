 # Ideas and Spirits
 GER_Triumph_Des_Willens: "Triumph des Willens"
 GER_Triumph_Des_Willens_desc: "After so many years, the Thousand Year Reich is victorious against the forces of Judeo-Bolshevism, and the Aryan People stand united and together!\n\nThis victory is not only the victory of the magnificent leadership of the Führer, or the great military leadership, but of every Aryan, every worker, every soldier, every teacher, all of whom contributed to the war effort.\n\nNow the great reich looks to our bright and glorious future, one purged of filthy degenerates and the taint of liberalism, where every Aryan can look around and see a prosperous community of hard working people.\n\nSieg Heil!\nSieg Heil!\nSieg Heil!"
 GER_Oberkommando_Der_Wehrmacht: "German General Staff"
 GER_Oberkommando_Der_Wehrmacht_desc: "The German High Command has been the finest in europe ever since it was designed by General Moltke the Elder, constantly improving on German tactics, weapons, logistics, and soldiers. The Reich inherited this, and the High Command would aid it well across the war, allowing Germany to become a force to be reckoned with in military strategy.\n\nHowever, these smart, and often popular generals pose a potential threat to the Führer, and so he has many times vetoed their decisions, usually to the detriment of Germany, increasing their mistrust of him.\n\nHowever, as long as the two work together and form a consensus, Germany will always have one of it's most valuable assets to call on."
 GER_Hitlerjugend: "Hitlerjugend"
 GER_Hitlerjugend_desc: "The Hitler Youth are an organisation dedicated to training and teaching young Aryans of National Socialist Ideology, Camaraderie, their duty towards the Reich, and absolute loyalty to the Führer. After all other youth groups were banned, the Hitler Youth skyrocketed in popularity.\n\nHowever, some claim there is a darker side. Judaic Conspirators claim that Hitler Youth girls come home pregnant, and that children are told to spy on their own parents. Obviously these are lies, meant to defame the great Reich, however many believe this and have campaigned for the end of the group.\n\nWhile it may have flaws, the Hitlerjugend will continue teaching the Aryan Youth of the greatness of the Thousand Year Reich."
 GER_Militarism_Of_The_Reich: "Militarism of the Reich"
 GER_Militarism_Of_The_Reich_desc: "The Reich has been forced to return to it's Prussian roots in order to destroy Liberalism, and as such the Military is extremely impressive, with the greatest tech in the world, the best high command, and an almost infinite supply of manpower.\n\nAlthough this has enabled us to pursue and keep our grand conquests, it also provides a large financial problem, with almost every resource and man devoted to the military, hampering civilian production and causing general unrest, especially in conquered territory and the Reichkommasariats, whose men and material have been forced to work for our ever-expanding war machine.\n\nThis war machine presents a sort of circular horror, where the expanding war machine requires new resources and men to be fed to it, forcing it to invade more nations and expand, making enemies and forcing it to be expanded, and thus the cycle goes on. Although it has worked until now, it is unsustainable, and unless we curb the military we might face massive social and economic unrest."

 # Decisions and Categories
 DC_GER_Party_Split: "The Party Split"
 DC_GER_Party_Split_desc: "Although the NSDAP has largely been purged of rivals, a few still remain influential, and the NSDAP has split into 3 major factions. These are:\n\n§RStrasserists§!, whom support Otto Strasser in his unique form of National Socialism, placing a strong emphasis on anti-capitalism and a critique of the Reich's slide into Corporatism. Although most influential Strasserists were purged on the Night of the Long Knives, a few still remain, and are slowly building up support. Their support value is currently at [?GER_strasserist_value].\n\nThe §GThule Society§!, a Germanic Occultist group obsessed with Aryanism and the "lost land" of Thule, an island commonly located by Greeks and Roman cartogrophers to be the most northern point, and to them the capital of Hyperborea,  believing that this land was the origins of the Aryan race. Their obsession with Aryanism even leads them to require their members to sign an oath claiming that they or their wives both contain no "coloured" blood. Although cracked down on after the National Socialists took power, they still lurk in the shadows and have found an ally in Heinrich Himmler, leader of the Schutzstaffel, and who is much more interested in Esoteric Occultism than the Führer. Their support value is currently at [?GER_thule_society_value].\n\n§CHitlerists§!, supporting Hitler's brand of National Socialism, which places strong anti-socialist and anti-communist rhetoric, and has taken a more friendly view to corporations, as long as they serve the Reich in it's efforts. This is the most mainstream version of National Socialism, possibly due to the fact that all other versions have had their supporters round up and their leaders killed. Their support value is currently at [?GER_hitlerist_value]."

 GER.1.title: "Death of Adolf Hitler"
 GER.1.desc: "The Führer has died.\n\nYesterday, Herr Hitler was found dead in his lair by widow Eva Braun. The government has been rushing to put together a response to the Führer's death and the Reichstag currently controls the government. Soon, the Reichstag is predicted to pick a successor to the Führer.\n\nAcross the world, governments and agencies from across the right have paid respects and condolences to Hitler including a statement from the Italian government that they would strongly support the Reichstag on whatever decision they are bound to take. Other nations were much more stern towards us on their response. President Wallace reportedly said "the hanging bastard rots in hell" and Attlee didn't comment on the matter.\n\nThe future paths for the future of the German nation are well paved. Now, the Reichstag picks which route they take."
 GER.1.a: "Sieg Heil!"
 
 # Focuses
 GER_Triumph_Des_Willens_Focus: "Triumph des Willens"
 GER_Triumph_Des_Willens_Focus_desc: "It is finally finished. The war is done. The vile Judeo-Bolshevik threat is mostly gone. The Second World War has essentially erased the posing threat to the Reich. Our nation's borders have flooded out and new Reichskommissariats, Reichsprotektorats, and Generalgouvernements have been established across the continent to assert our dominance. Now the second part of this is restabilizing the new lands of our Reich.\n\nThe 1949 Nuremburg rally is around the corner. We must send masses of Germans and Aryans to Nuremburg to praise and defend the goals and powers of the Reich in Europe. This is the first step in the long and sometimes, frustrating, process that this will be. However, the nation stands at a crossroads. It's either Hitler's Germany or no Germany.\n\nSieg Heil!"

 # Leader Descriptions
 POLITICS_ADOLF_HITLER_DESC: "Who would've thought that a sickly boy who wanted to be an artist would become the single-most powerful man in the world?\n\nFollowing the devastation of the First World War, Corporal Adolf Hitler returned to a Germany in ruin. All around him, he saw rot and greed. It was not long before he found the source: the Jews. They had been welcomed as guests, but thought to act as the hosts. Hitler would make sure that their evil was exposed and destroyed- and so he did. Taking charge of the then-young Nazi Party, Hitler led the party to victory in election after election. In 1932, the NSDAP became the largest party in Germany, and the next year Hitler was declared Führer of all Germany.\n\nBy the end of 1946, Hitler's dream of a Germany and a Europe free from Judeo-Bolshevik and Judeo-Capitalist influence had been achieved. True, the Bolshevik Jews are still around, but they are scattered and thus pose little threat. The American Mongrels, however, still controlled by the Jewish Capitalists, remains in a position to oppose the Reich.\n\nNow an old man, Hitler can feel the Reaper's cold breath on his shoulder as the inevitable fate of all men inches ever closer. He wonders if there is still enough time for him to ensure the safety of the Reich's future..."
