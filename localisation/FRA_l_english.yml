 phillipe_petain_desc:0 "Petain fought proudly in the Great War. Highly esteemed for his valiant defense of Verdun against the Germans, Petain found himself to be a post war celebrity, a General, and the Co-Dean for the Academie Francaise. Petain entered Politics when he was sent to deal with a massive scandal-turned riot, and was asked to become a Minister of War. Petain gladly accepting. Now in French Politics, Petain grew more and more distrustful of the increasing secularization of the French State, with the main government refusing to give him the Minister of Education. This culminated in his resignation in 1935. Petain then refrained from the Public Eye until 1939, when he was asked to become the new ambassador to Spain, and after Hitler’s invasion of France in 1940, Minister of War once more. Petain clashed with De Gaulle on the Defense of France for weeks, until there was no more France. De Gaulle wanted a Free France. Petain surrendered. Thus started the era of the German Jackboot. Petain didn’t want to be a “Caesar '' as he called himself, so mostly became a figurehead to his cabinet and German interests, but he was still the figurehead of the surrender, and the French people haven’t forgiven him.

 FRA_The_Lost_Democracy: "The Lost Democracy"

Some few continue to resist, but they are insignificant in the grand scheme of things, and the majority of the French people hardly remember the Republic, and there is a large section of the population that do not want the Republic to return in any case. Though the same distrust and even hatred of the Germans still lives on in France, many thank the Reich for saving them from the evils of Capitalism, Liberalism and Bolshevism."
 FRA_Rise_And_Resist: "Rise and Resist"
 FRA_Rise_And_Resist_desc: "Our Nazi overlords have conquered France and consolidated influence in our lands. Despite their greatest and strongest efforts from Berlin, brave and anti-fascist resistance groups have broken the peace using violence, espionage, and fraud to deceive our federal and intelligence institutions and find loopholes through our nation's broken politics. They try to assassinate and attack our generals and commandants and one thing is certain for the future of the French State and it's that these radical and insane warmongers must be stopped in their horrendous tracks. We in France need unity and to get it, we must end the insurrection that these spies and criminals create."
