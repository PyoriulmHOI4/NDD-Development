 # Leader Descriptions
 USA_Henry_Wallace_Description: "Henry Agard Wallace is a proud representative of the American people. As the Vice President for about four years before taking on the Presidency, Wallace has been denoted for his progressive and social democratic views and ideas for the American nation. Once sitting President Franklin Delano Roosevelt was dead, Wallace was to step up and finish the war efforts. While the battle in Europe didn't exactly end in his favor, Wallace achieved a remarkable victory over the imperialists in the East.\n\nNow, as the incumbent President of the United States, he has the role of leading a nuclear power through a disastrous and dangerous time. Wallace has vowed to give stronger and more reliable rights to minorities and female communities and proves to be a strong opponent of the fascist regimes in Europe. However, through his presidency, whispers in the room emerge, supporting his changing America in a changing era. However, new demands are on the table.\n\n§RPerhaps Wallace should get around to reading those demands...§!"

 # Spirit Names & Descriptions
 USA_Civil_Rights_Movement: "Civil Rights Movement"
 USA_Civil_Rights_Movement_desc: "For centuries, oppression and unfairness have plagued immigrants, women, African-Americans, and other excluded groups. Now, it sees its stop as protests and demonstrations have begun to take it back.\n\nOppressed and hated groups have risen in droves to combat and resist the institutions that continue to segregate and discriminate based on race, ethnicity, sexuality, gender, and other dividing factors. This, combined with America's new anti-fascist and interventionist foreign policy, has given a quick rise to a so-called counterculture movement that resists the warmongering and violent foreign policy that has caused suffering to spread across the globe like a pandemic.\n\nWhispers across the hall from the White House make demands for change. The whispers march closer and closer to the front lawn. Now the nation stands at a crossroad and it's either defend the house or give in."
 USA_Refuse_Fascism: "Refuse Fascism"
 USA_Refuse_Fascism_desc: "Refuse Fascism is a governmental organization founded by President Wallace as a response to the cloud of autocracy, totalitarianism, and fascism that has corrupted Europe. The organization seeks to track down and mitigate the influence of fascist and extremist groups such as that of William Dudley Pelley's Silver Legion of America and other far-right partisans.\n\nSo far, the organization has seen very little success in the real world whereas the government has spent high amounts of money on keeping it alive. Most who back the organization's very existence include our foreign minister, James Francis Byrnes. Many, including the incumbent president, have felt that it was time to end the organization and instead rebrand it into a much more popular and effective committee under the same purpose. The only question now is, will it work?"
 USA_Bastion_Of_Democracy_Idea: "Bastion of Democracy"
 USA_Bastion_Of_Democracy_Idea_desc: "The United States of America is the Last Bastion of Democracy in the world, and has subsequently taken it upon itself to lead and protect the so-called "Free World". Heading the United Nations, America is hell-bent on ensuring the total destruction of Fascism within the Free World, and preparing to liberate Europe and Africa from the jackboot of Fascist Tyranny as soon as feasible- which, for many, cannot be soon enough. The claim to be the "Last Bastion" have not sat entirely well with other members of the United Nations, particularly those in the British Commonwealth, who find themselves increasingly at-odds with America. In addition, the claims that America is "fighting for liberty, freedom and human rights in the world" has sparked a new wave of not only Patriotism, but also emboldened the various groups and persons leading the proverbial charge in the Civil Rights Movement."

 USA.1.title: "Henry Wallace's Second Inaugural Address"
 USA.1.desc: "\"Ladies and Gentlemen of the United States of America, I stand here not as I would have liked. To be perfectly honest, I would've liked to have been standing here as the President who brought down the Fascist Reich and her allies last year, but that is not who I am. I am the President who has presided over possibly the greatest tragedy in world history, and possibly the most humiliating peace deal in American history. I will not try to hide behind excuses, for there are none that would suffice in this situation. I will, instead, thank you for your willingness to give me a second chance as your President, to correct the mistakes I made in my first term, and to establish a firm opposition to Fascism in the Free World. \n\nWe have before us two paths: one in which the world is free, and one in which it is enslaved. I pledge to you here and now that America under my Second Administration will be the Defender of Freedom, Liberty and Justice in the Free World, and that we will, without ceasing, fight tyranny in all its forms, and protect the Rights of All Peoples of the Earth at every turn. Our enemy is perhaps the strongest foe we have ever faced, but I refuse to believe that it will be our death knell. I refuse to allow Freedom, Liberty and Justice to perish from this Earth!\n\nGod Bless The Last Bastion! God Bless America!\""
 USA.1.a: "Liberty First!"
 USA.2.title: "1949 State of the Union"
 USA.2.desc: "\"Ladies and Gentlemen of Congress, I thank you for coming. This is perhaps one of the most important State-of-the-Union Addresses in American history, as it comes at a time when our liberty, freedom and democracy are under the greatest threat they have been since the Civil War. This past year, we were forced to sign a peace treaty with the Germans and Italians- possibly the most humiliating peace in American history. I will not make excuses for signing that treaty, but neither will I apologize. All the information I was receiving told me that there was no feasible way for us to win the war, and I stand by my decision to contact Berlin and make peace. \n\nDespite the unfortunately necessary peace with Berlin and Rome, we have managed to maintain steady economic growth, averaging at around +4% in the last year. Unemployment is down to just 7%, and is predicted to decrease further to just 5% at the current rate of job-creation. Our GDP this past year has been stronger than it was even at the height of the war, with an average Household Income, so I am told, of around $1,800 per month- no doubt due to the policies of the Fair Deal that this Congress chose to implement on my proposal.\n\nOf course, this has all been in just the last year. We surely have much further to go, and much more to achieve- and I have no doubt that we will!\""
 USA.2.a: "God Bless America!"
