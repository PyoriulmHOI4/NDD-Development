 # Leader Descriptions
 SPA_Francisco_Franco_Desc: "The Caudillo of Spain came out of the civil war with a thirst for nationalism and a crunch for power.\n\nBorn into a military family in Ferrol, Franco quickly rose through the ranks of the military and, at age 33, became the youngest general in Spain and eventually headed the Zaragoza Military Academy. He was a conservative and monarchist, Franco opposed the abolition of the monarchy. He was devastated by the closing of the Academy, but continued to reluctantly serve. Then, when fascist groups and the Falange were founded, he joined those groups and eventually rose the ranks to become a frontline advocate for the parties. Then the coup began and war broke out.\n\nFranco served the Nationalist faction in the Spanish Civil War. He had a wave of support and was chosen as the Head of State for the Nationalists. His close collaboration with other generals and history of military experience and privilege was certainly a reason why he won the war.\n\nWith Franco in power and change coming to the world, the planet finds itself at a crossroads. To survive, Spain must forge its way and lead its people to victory."
 # Spirit Names & Descriptions
 SPA_Scratches_Of_The_Civil_War: "Scratches of the Civil War"
 SPA_Scratches_Of_The_Civil_War_desc: "Although the Civil War ended decades ago, its marks still haunt Spain. Not economically, those problems were fixed long ago. Rather, waves of political dissidents still secretely operate in Spain, including the CNT. These organizations force us to keep on our toes, lest we anger the populace and make them sympathetic to dissident causes. Therefore, they must be crushed completely, or our nation will crash."
 SPA_Nationalistic_Sentiment: "Nationalistic Sentiment"
 SPA_Nationalistic_Sentiment_desc: "The social desires of the Nationalist faction differs greatly from that of the former Republicans. While Republicans have been more tolerant to the other ethnicities with separate identities, the Spanish see the nation differently, rather seeing one Spanish identity as the uniting factor of the nation. This has led to tough repression and punishment of Catalan, Basque, and other nationalist groups and individuals.\n\nIs this identifying factor moral? That's not the question. In Spain's sense, it's how will it work and for how long?"
 SPA_Neutral_Foreign_Policy: "Neutral Foreign Policy"
 SPA_Neutral_Foreign_Policy_desc: "Most of the world was given a choice between the Axis and the Allies with no in-between. However, Spain's strategy was able to work around those boundaries and find itself in a precarious and protected position, with no strong preference. The Spanish can be seen in close collaboration with Hitler and the Axis, though the Caudillo has chosen to stay out of wars and has refused to send foreign aid. Despite the close lines with the Axis, the new strategy seems to work. The question now is can the Spanish uphold it?"
